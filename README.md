 Dedicated-Microprocessor-to-Display-a-Simple-Coloured-Box-on-a-VGA-Monitor

Design Methodology
#Schematic for processor in directory
#Xilinx ISE used for design using VHDL
#The processor consists of a Datapath and Control Unit.
#Synthesis and Implementation For FPGA
#Design synthesised correctly for the retired Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA
#The spartan 3 can be used as reference when deciding an FPGA for synthesis/implementation of this project.
